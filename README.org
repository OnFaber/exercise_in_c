** Twice the Sum

Here is part of a program that begins by having the user input three integers:

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void)
  {
    int a, b, c, sum;
    printf("Input three integers: ");
  }
#+end_src

Complete the program so that when the user executes it and types in 2, 3, and 7, this is what appears on the screen:

#+begin_src sh
  Input three integers: 2 3 7
  Twice the sum of your integers plus 7 is 31 --- bye!
#+end_src
